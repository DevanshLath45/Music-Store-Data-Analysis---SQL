## **Project Overview**

I analyzed a dataset of Music Store like database. This project involved extensive querying to explore **customer preferences**, **identifying trends**, and **sales trends** using **Microsoft SQL Server**. Throughout the analysis, I addressed various SQL problems related to **customer trends**, **product sales**, and **popular genres**.

The project mainly focuses on solving real-world business problems using structured queries.

## ERD Diagram
An ERD diagram is included to visually represent the database schema and relationships between tables.
In this I have used 11 tables and the ERD diagram as shown below.

## **Task: Data Cleaning**

- **Removed Duplicates:** Identified and eliminated duplicate records in the `customer`, and `invoice` tables  
- **Checked for Missing Values:** Conducted a thorough review across all five tables; no critical missing data required correction  
- **Analyzed Null Values:** Evaluated null entries across all tables; found no necessary changes needed

## **Objective and Business Problems**

The primary objective of this project is to analyze the music store database to uncover sales patterns, customer preferences, and product performance, enabling data-driven business decisions. The analysis covers various aspects like:
- Identify the **highest spending customer** to target key accounts  
- Calculate the **total spending of customers by artist** to understand artist popularity and revenue contribution  
- Determine the **most popular music genre by country** to reveal regional preferences  
- Analyze the **city with the highest total invoice amounts** to pinpoint top revenue locations  
- Additional problems can be found in the [Questions.pdf](https://github.com/DevanshLath45/Music-Store-Data-Analysis---SQL/blob/main/Questions.pdf) file.

## **Identifying Business Problems**

Key business problems identified:
1. **Frantisek**, with **customer ID 5**, spent **$145**, highlighting a key high-value customer.
2. **Hugh Reilly** spent the most on the artist **Queen**.
3. **Rock** is the most popular genre in **9 out of 10 countries**.
4. **Prague** is the city with the highest invoice totals.
5. See the [Outputs.pdf](https://github.com/DevanshLath45/Music-Store-Data-Analysis---SQL) file for additional outputs generated from the analysis.
